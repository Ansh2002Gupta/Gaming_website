# Introduction

# Achitectural Design
*Webpages* <br>
Webpages have been created with the help of HTML and their designing have been done using CSS.
<br> *Communicaton with the virtual private server* <br>
The instructions for the browser to communicate with the VPS are provided through PHP. The results of these communications are then displayed on the webpage.
<br> *User Authenthication for SignIn/SignUp* <br>
I used a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web named *phpMyadmin*. This database not only contains the details of the user by also contains the rating as given by the user and their suggestions if any.
